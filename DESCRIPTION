Description: For internal use by the DeCarvalho and Constantinides labs at Scripps 
    Research. Provides a comprehensive suite of helper functions for single-cell RNA-seq
    and ATAC-seq analysis workflows. Includes helper tools/wrappers for clustering, cell 
    type annotation with SingleR, differential expression analysis (pseudobulk, Wilcoxon,
    bulk RNA-seq), differential accessibility analysis, pathway enrichment (GO,
    Metascape), T-cell receptor repertoire analysis, cell-cell communication
    analysis with CellChat, motif enrichment, cNMF gene program analysis, and
    advanced visualizations including volcano plots, scatterplots, heatmaps, and
    circos diagrams. Designed to streamline end-to-end single-cell analysis with
    consistent interfaces and automated output generation, enabling iterative frictionless 
    analysis of datasets. It builds on on functionality provided by single 
    cell analysis packages such as Seurat, Signac, and others such as SingleR, DESeq2, 
    CellChat. It operates with Seurat objects in R only (no support for scran or scanpy).
